You are tasked with creating a new page inside the app folder of an existing Next.js project called "appp2". This page will focus on the history of Pokemon and should be styled using Tailwind CSS with a dark, modern, and creative theme. Your goal is to seamlessly integrate this new content with the existing app structure and style.

- First, review the existing app structure:

1. Create a new file named "pokemon-history.js" (or "pokemon-history.tsx" if using TypeScript) in the appropriate directory within the app folder.

2. Set up the basic structure of the page component, including necessary imports and the main functional component.

3. Incorporate the provided Pokemon history content into the component, structuring it logically with appropriate headings, paragraphs, and sections.

4. Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the page. Ensure that you:
   - Apply a dark theme (use classes like "bg-gray-900" for background and "text-white" for text)
   - Create a modern and creative layout (consider using grid or flexbox for layout)
   - Add interactive elements or animations to enhance user experience
   - Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes

5. To maintain seamless integration with existing content:
   - Review the styling of other pages in the app and use similar color schemes, font styles, and layout patterns
   - Utilize any existing components or layouts that are common across the app
   - Ensure that navigation to and from this new page is consistent with the rest of the app

6. Add appropriate metadata for SEO purposes, including a title and description.

7. Test the page to ensure it renders correctly and is responsive on different devices.

Please provide your implementation in the following format:

<implementation>
// File: app/pokemon-history.js (or .tsx)

// [Include your full code implementation here, including imports, component definition, and JSX structure with Tailwind CSS classes]
</implementation>

Remember to focus on creating a dark, modern, and creative theme while ensuring seamless integration with the existing app structure and style.
