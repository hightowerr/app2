You are tasked with improving the design of a Pokemon Pokedex site experience. Your goal is to make it more modern and creative using Tailwind CSS, enhance the quality of Pokemon images, add more information about the Pokemon, and ensure the design is responsive and mobile-friendly.

- First, review the current design of the Pokedex site:

To improve the design, follow these steps:

1. Enhance the overall design using Tailwind CSS:
   - Use a modern color scheme that complements the Pokemon theme
   - Implement a card-based layout for each Pokemon
   - Add subtle animations and hover effects to make the interface more interactive
   - Utilize Tailwind's utility classes for spacing, typography, and flexbox layouts

2. Improve the quality of Pokemon images:
   - Use high-resolution images for each Pokemon
   - Implement lazy loading for images to improve performance
   - Add a subtle drop shadow or glow effect to make images pop

3. Include more information about each Pokemon:
   - Display the Pokemon's type(s) with corresponding color-coded badges
   - Show base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.) using progress bars or charts
   - Include a brief description of the Pokemon's characteristics or abilities
   - Add evolution chain information if available

4. Ensure responsiveness and mobile-friendliness:
   - Use Tailwind's responsive classes to adjust layouts for different screen sizes
   - Implement a collapsible navigation menu for mobile devices
   - Ensure touch-friendly interactions for mobile users
   - Optimize image sizes for faster loading on mobile devices

5. Additional features to consider:
   - Add a search functionality to find Pokemon quickly
   - Implement filtering options (e.g., by type, generation)
   - Include a "Random Pokemon" feature for discovery

Please provide your improved design in HTML format with embedded Tailwind CSS classes. Start your response with <improved_design> and end it with </improved_design>. Include comments in your code to explain key design decisions and Tailwind CSS usage.

Remember to balance aesthetics with functionality, ensuring that the design enhances the user experience while maintaining the essence of a Pokedex. Your design should be visually appealing, informative, and user-friendly across all devices.
